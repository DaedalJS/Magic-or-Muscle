# Magic-or-Muscle
this was started as my final project for the TrueCoder's coding bootcamp that taught me how to program.

battle chance is 20% at lowest and raises 10% for each area without a battle.  it lowers at most 20% after a battle.

magic attacks beat muscle defense/counters, 

muscle attacks beat magic defense/counters,

defense beats the attacks of their own kind.

counters and defenses are draws.

draws are sometimes bad for both sometimes bad for one (50/50 chance) and sometimes just cancel each other out.

dodge chance varies from 40% to 60%

mana gets used while you travel to heal you.

your mana only refills during travels while you're at full health or a bit if you were missing less than the full heal amount.

each time you choose to move to the next town it increases the number of enemies an area can have by 1 up to a maximum of 5.
